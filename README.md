## About The Project

This is a Python script that implements a web application using the Flask framework. The web application allows a user to create, access and delete encrypted messages. Recaptcha is optional but build in with config file.

## Built With

This code is built using the Flask micro-framework for Python. Flask is a lightweight web development framework that makes it easy to build web applications quickly. The code uses Flask to define routes for handling HTTP requests and to render HTML templates using the Jinja2 template engine. It also uses cryptography for encrypting and decrypting messages, and sqlite3 for storing messages in a database.

## Prerequisites

*Python 3.x

*Flask (a Python micro framework for web development)

*cryptography (a Python library for secure encryption and decryption)

*sqlite3 (a Python library for working with SQLite databases)

*configparser (a Python library for fetching config files)

## Usage

Simply execute the script.py

Recaptcha is disabled by default, to activate it change the content of config.ini
